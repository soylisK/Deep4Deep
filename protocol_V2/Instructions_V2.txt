********************************************************

Welcome to the 2017 automatic speaker verification spoofing and countermeasures challenge (ASVspoof2017) database VERSION 2. 

Here is a description of training, development, and evaluation data.

1. ASVspoof2017_V2_train, ASVspoof2017_V2_dev and ASVspoof2017_V2_eval directories contain audio files used for training, development and evaluation (T_*.wav, D_*.wav and E_*.wav, respectively). The waveforms in the directories are in the standard RIFF/WAVE format. The sampling rate is 16 kHz, and stored in 16-bit format.

    
2. protocol directory contains protocol files in ASCII format for training, development and evaluation.

   protocol_V2/ASVspoof2017_V2_train.trn.txt: contains a file list to be used to train human and spoofed speech detectors.
   protocol_V2/ASVspoof2017_V2_dev.trl.txt : contains a development trial list to validate the spoofing detector.
   protocol_V2/ASVspoof2017_V2_eval.trl.txt : contains an evaluation trial list to evaluate the spoofing detector.

    The three files have the same format and the meaning of each column is listed as follows:
        1st column: unique file ID
        2nd column: speech type identifier: genuine means the trial is original speech; spoof means the file is created with replay attack.
        3rd column: speaker ID
        4th column: RedDots common phrase ID
        5th column: Environment ID ('-' for genuine speech)
        6th column: Playback device ID ('-' for genuine speech)
        7th column: Recording device ID ('-' for genuine speech)

    The file for each training sample can be located at ASVspoof2017_V2_train/unique_file_ID.wav
    The file for each development trial sample can be located at ASVspoof2017_V2_dev/unique_file_ID.wav
    The file for each evaluation trial sample can be located at ASVspoof2017_V2_eval/unique_file_ID.wav

The following is the details of the RedDots common phrase IDs (4th column):

    S01: 'My voice is my password'
    S02: 'OK Google'
    S03: 'Only lawyers love millionaires'
    S04: 'Artificial intelligence is for real'
    S05: 'Birthday parties have cupcakes and ice cream'
    S06: 'Actions speak louder than words'
    S07: 'There is no such thing as a free lunch'
    S08: 'A watched pot never boils'
    S09: 'Jealousy has twenty-twenty vision'
    S10: 'Necessity is the mother of invention'

    Participants can use the information in the 3-7th column of the training and development set to tune their systems. However, the final performance is only based on the 2nd column (classification performance of human or spoof). Even if columns 3-7th are also provided for the evaluation set, such information is intended to support further analysis of results rather than to be used for system tuning.

Differently from the 2015 edition (where EERs were first computed per spoofing attack and then averaged to form a single scalar summary), in ASVspoof 2017 the summary EER should be computed from scores pooled across all the trial segments. We recommend to use BOSARIS program (https://sites.google.com/site/bosaristoolkit/) for computing the EERs. 

For details about the task, please refer to the evaluation plan, which is available at: http://www.spoofingchallenge.org/
